## Setup

Same way you would install a typical laravel application.

    composer install

    npm install

    php artisan key:gen

    php artisan migrate

    php artisan db:seed --class=HmoSeeder

    php artisan serve

The UI is displayed on the root page

Don't forget to run `npm run dev` after modifying the vue component.

Lastly, run `php artisan test --testsuite=Feature` to run tests for API
